A simple memory game I made for a school assignment with Java Swing. This is the NetBeans project.

Original graphics resources are in the "img/resources" folder.

Texts were made with this online Pokemon font generator:

I used GIMP 2 (at home) and Adobe Photoshop (at school) for image editing.

I hope it will prove useful for someone.

Note: altough I like this project and its source code, it doesn't neccessarily reflect my current programming skills and style.
At the time of uploading, it is already several months(!) old.
