A simple memory game I made as a school assignment with Java Swing. This is the NetBeans project.

Original graphics resources are in the "img/resources" folder.

Texts were made with this online Pokemon font generator:

I used GIMP 2 (at home) and Adobe Photoshop (at school) for image editing.

I hope it will prove useful for someone.
